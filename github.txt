Nano “patterns.txt”
Cat “test.txt”
(the diagram says symmetry.py) diff patterns.txt symmetry.txt
Mv patterns.txt ~/math/calculus/
Rm ~/math/geometry
Cd ../math
Git init math/
Git remote 
Cp -r symmetry.txt ~/math/
Git status, I don’t think symmetry.txt has been staged so git should not be tracking symmetry.txt
Git add ~/math/symmetry.txt, git add .
Yes it is tracking, use the restore command
Git commit -m “added files to local repository”
Git push origin main. I should be pushing to the main branch because no other branches have been made yet
Git branch applied_math
Git checkout applied_math
git push origin applied_math, git won’t know what should be saved in the locations
Git branch, applied_math
Git checkout main
Git merge applied_math (assuming you have switched into the main branch)
