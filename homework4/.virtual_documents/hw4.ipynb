# NameError: name 'is_in_range' is not defined: This means there is no function/variable with that name. The reason why this occurred is because I copied the test cases from the code and forgot to change the function name. It was fixed by changing the function name.
# SyntaxError: invalid syntaxsentence = word1 + " " word2 + " " + word3 + " " + word4 + " "+ word5. This error means that there is something wrong with the structure of the line. In this case, I forgot a plus sign so I added a plus sign where required.

# Your thinking process and description here (I'm doing this before the lecture so I have no idea what this is going to be about)
# I mean there isn't much thinking process. I just set each arithmetic calculation to a separate variable, inputted them into the list, and returned that list. Although this function could've been done in 1 line, splitting it over 1 line makes it a bit cleaner imo.
# The return statement is pretty short and the work is done before the return statement. There is also a simple comment which tells us about the function. 
# The variable names are meaningful and not generic as well.





# Your code here
def increment_and_multiply(num_1):
    # This function increments a given number by 5 and then multiplies the number by 3.
    incremented = num_1+5
    multiplied = incremented*3
    return multiplied

def check_range(x,low,high):
    # This function checks whether x is within the range of low and high inclusive. Mathematically, this checks if x is within [low, high]
    if(x<=high and x>= low):
        return True
    else:
        return False
print(check_range(5, 1, 10)) # expected True
print(check_range(15, 1, 10)) # expected False
print(check_range(10, 5, 15)) # expected True
print(check_range(10, 0, 100)) # expected True
print(check_range(101, 0, 100)) # expected False





# Your thinking process and description here
# My thinking process was that I could use the "and" comparator to check if it met both requirements of being <= high and >= low all at one. 
# The return statement is short and very straightforward. The comment about the function is also pretty solid since I explained it in words and mathematically
